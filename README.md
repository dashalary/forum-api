## Forum

Welcome to Forum! This app was made to facilitate conversations and engagement through posts and comments. It uses a Rails API backend and a React-Redux frontend, the latter of which can be found here: https://github.com/dashalary/forum-client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Installation


To begin, clone and open both repositories. Open the frontend repository and run the following commands in your terminal in order to install the necessary packages:

``$npm install``
``$npm start``



In the backend, run:

``$rails db:migrate``
``$rails s``
